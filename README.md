This is a simple snake game written in java.
I am not too familiar with java and a great way to learn a programming language is to make a simple game with it 

There are bugs such as when pressing buttons too much and at the same time the snakes body just falls apart. 

## to build and run:
```

$ javac src/Snake/*.java && mv src/Snake/*.class bin/Snake
$ cd bin
$ java Snake.Game
```
